# WorX-Daily-Planner

## Let our Work Day Scheduler Web App help you stay organized and on schedule, with real time updates, an easy hourly planner, and locally stored data.

# Roadmap/ troubleshooting and improvements:

- Improved data
- "Time-Block" colors
- Real time reactivity
- More detailed task submissions
  (Company, local, subject.)
- General style and visual upgrades

During development we encountered issues with the local storage function and its consistency storing data, as well as an iussue with the color coded time blocks. (Code needs refinement, path is incomplete or faulty).
